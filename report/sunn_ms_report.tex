	Spatial prediciton and interpolation arises in many fields like blah blah blah.
	The random forest is blah blah blah.
	The Gaussian copula is an extension of the spatial linear model that blah blah blah.
	One sentence summary of simulation study results.

\section{Introduction}
Here is my introduction where I talk about the two methods: random forests\cite{rfsp} and Gaussian copula \cite{madsen09}

\section{Methods}
Here is my methods section where I talk about the math behind random forests and Gaussian copula\cite{verhoef02}.

\section{Results}
Here is my results section where I talk about the outcome of my simulation studies

\section{Conclusion}
Here is a conclusion where I will probably say something like Gaussian copula is better because statistics over machine learning 5ever.
